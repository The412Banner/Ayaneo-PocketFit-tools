# Ayaneo-PocketFit-tools
Misc tools I or anyone can use for this device or similar from Ayaneo 

Here you will find stock boot back up images created by myself before I rooted my device (Ayaneo Konkr Pocket Fit g3 gen3)

also a slightly rewritten root script that pulls the magisk root payload from here rather than its original source due to being inaccessible to some users because of region or ISP blocks.  I did not write this script or put it together originally, all credit goes to the original writer and developer of it using whatever tools they did to do so.  Can be found here
